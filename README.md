# php_bot
developing a php web bot app for personal learning purposes

php_bot basic to-do
1. [no bot needed- login details] basic social media account details setup. (could be done later)

2. development of simple reader and writer bot, with flavour text and no-spam timings, probably won't link to content DB.
    *test timings with simple file io
    *setup a test dynamo on Heroku

3. may test with linking to a instagram or similar web services, quote of the day, as content DB.

4. testing phase, will have to check policies of social media account, so I don't run afoul of anti-bot protections.

5. Profit?
